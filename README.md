# Text-Encryption
## Overview

This project implements a simple text encryption and decryption system. The main goal is to provide a secure method for users to encrypt their sensitive text data. The application uses various encryption algorithms to ensure data confidentiality.

## Features

- **Text Encryption**: Securely encrypt plain text using selected algorithms.
- **Text Decryption**: Decrypt previously encrypted text back to its original form.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for inputting text and selecting encryption options.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Supports multiple encryption algorithms (e.g., AES, DES, RSA).
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on different operating systems.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `cryptography` for encryption and decryption
  - `tkinter` for the graphical user interface (GUI)
- **Version Control**: Git

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Siddharthan03/Text-Encryption.git
   cd text-encryption
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app.py
## Usage
- Launch the application.
- Enter the text you want to encrypt.
